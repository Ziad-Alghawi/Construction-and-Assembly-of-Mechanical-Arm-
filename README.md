First, I downloaded the files from the GitHub of the Smart Methods page.

After that, I created an account on the Tinkercad website.

I uploaded the tools and models to the tinkercad.

Then I started trying to create a model of the arm.

I put the base piece first.

Then I connected it with the Waist piece.

In the end I connected the Gripper .
